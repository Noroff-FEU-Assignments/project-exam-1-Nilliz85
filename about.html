                  Hi, and welcome. My name is Per Edward i'm 37 years old and the father of 3. And i am now halfway through a 2 year long course to become a frontend developer. i
                  have worked with many different things since i moved out at the age of 15. I have always been very interested in computers but i have also enjoyed creating
                  things.so as a combination of this i truly feel that frontend is the one true path for me.
                </p>

                <p>
                  there are several things about this profession which i feel very intrieged by and i was thinking this blog would be a good place to share them, along with my
                  thoughts and my progress in the field. and of coarse also my career goals and things i learn along the way. and who knows. maybe some of topic things about life
                  in general or some other things i enjoy will find its way in here.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This blog will be like my portfolio blog kind of thing and i will try to update as often as possible. (please have a little patients as this is an exam assignment
                  and i need to fill up with some placeholders as to fill the criteria of the assignment. this will be updated as soon as the assignment is graded.)
